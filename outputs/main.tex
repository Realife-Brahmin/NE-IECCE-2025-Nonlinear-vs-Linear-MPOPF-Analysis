\maketitle


\begin{abstract}
    Multi-period optimal power flow (MPOPF) frameworks are increasingly gaining attention due to the growing integration of battery-based distributed energy resources (DERs) in electricity distribution networks (EDNs). While MPOPF problems are typically formulated as non-convex programming (NCP) using non-convex branch power flow models, slow convergence and high computational requirements have spurred research into linear programming (LP)-based OPF approaches, which introduce an optimality gap. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge no current work has explicitly investigated how EDN size and DER penetration levels influence this gap. In this article, we develop multi-period OPF models for EDNs, comparing NCP- and LP-based solutions for networks of different scales—specifically, a 10-bus (small) and an IEEE-123-bus (medium) system—under varying DER deployments. We analyze the resulting optimality gap and degree of infeasiblity via OpenDSS simulations. Our findings indicate that while the optimality gap of LP-based methods grows with network size, these approaches still deliver near-optimal solutions and offer substantially faster convergence than their NCP counterparts.

    % The development of the multi-period optimal power flow framework is gaining interest nowadays because of the large penetration of battery associated distributed energy resources (DERs) into electricity distribution networks (EDNs). Typically, the OPF problem is modeled as a non-convex programming (NCP) framework by employing the non-convex branch power flow model of EDNs. However, the slow convergence and large computation time of the NCP motivate researchers to explore the possibility of developing the linear programming (LP) based OPF portfolio at the expense of the optimality gap in the derived solutions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no state-of-the-art research has investigated the impact of EDN size on the optimality gap. In this context, this article aims to develop multi-period OPF models for EDNs and analyze their NCP- and LP-based solution processes across different EDN sizes, specifically 10-bus (small), IEEE-123 bus (medium), and 730-bus (large) test systems. The optimality gaps in the ACOPF solution and decision variables for each network are assessed by simulating the control decisions in the OpenDSS platform. The simulation results indicate that while the optimality gap due to LP increases with network size, it consistently delivers near-optimal solutions with fast convergence.
